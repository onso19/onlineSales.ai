Form Generator Application
This application allows users to dynamically create and manage form fields according to their requirements. Users can add, remove, and customize form fields, as well as save and load form configurations as JSON data.

Key Requirements
Dynamic Form Field Management: Users can add and remove form fields dynamically.
Field Types and Labels: Each form field includes a label and a corresponding component based on the field type.
Supported Field Types:
Text input
Text area
Dropdown
Checkbox
Radio button
Dropdown Options: Users can define a set of options for dropdown fields.
Form Submission and Validation: The application supports form submission and validation, displaying error messages for invalid fields.
Save and Load Form Configurations: Users can save and load form configurations as JSON data.
Additional Challenges (Optional)
Validation Rules:
Users can set validation rules for form fields, including required fields, minimum/maximum length, and specific formats (e.g., email, phone number).
Conditional Logic:
Implemented conditional logic for form fields, where the visibility of certain fields depends on the value of other fields. For example, showing marks input fields based on the selected qualification.
Added a feature where if the user is a government servant, the application prompts for a government ID as proof.
File Upload Fields:
Added support for file upload fields, including validation for file type and size.
